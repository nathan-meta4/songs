My grandfather's clock `我爺爺的鐘`
Was too large for the shelf, `對於架子來說太大了`
So it stood ninety years on the floor `所以它在地板上屹立了九十年`
It was taller by half than the old man himself `比老人本人高一半`
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more `雖然重量不超過1便士`
It was bought on the morn `它是在爺爺出生的`
of the day that he was born `那天早上買的`
And was always his treasure and pride `永遠是他的寶貝和驕傲`
But it stopped short, never to go again, `但但它靜下再也不走了`
When the old man died. `爺爺走後`

CHORUS:
Ninety years without slumbering. `九十年沒有沉睡`
(tick, tock, tick, tock)
His life seconds numbering. `他的生命秒數`
(tick, tock, tick, tock)
But it stopped short, never to go again, `但它靜下再也不走了`
When the old man died.`爺爺走後`

In watching its pendulum, swing to and fro `在觀看鐘擺,來回搖擺`
Many hours had he spent while a boy `小男孩花了許多時間在此`
And in childhood and manhood `長大後他仍是如此`
The clock seemed to know `時鐘似乎知道`
And to share both his grief and his joy `並分享他的悲傷和喜悅`
For it struck twenty-four `因為它敲打了二十四下`
When he entered at the door `當他進入門口時`
With a blooming and beautiful bride `有一個盛開的美麗的新娘`
But it stopped short, never to go again, `但它靜下再也不走了`
When the old man died. `爺爺走後`

My grandfather said `我祖父說`
that of those he could hire `他可以僱用的人中`
Not a servant so faithful he found `沒有一個僕人如此忠誠`
For it wasted no time, `因為沒有浪費時間`
And had but one desire `並且只有一個願望`
At the close of each week to be wound. `在每個星期的結束時要傷口。`
And it kept in its place, `它保持在原地，`
Not a frown upon its face, `不皺眉`
And its hand never hung by its side. `而且它的手永遠不會掛在身邊`
But it stopped short, never to go again, `但它靜下再也不走了`
When the old man died. `爺爺走後`

It rang an alarm in the dead of the night `夜深人靜`
An alarm that for years had been dumb `多年以來一直愚蠢的警報`
And we knew that his spirit `我們知道他的精神`
Was pluming for flight `正在飛行中`
That his hour of departure had come. `他的出發時間已經到了`
Still the clock kept the time `時鐘仍然保留時間`
With a soft and muffled chime `發出柔軟而悶悶的鐘聲`
As we silently stood by his side. `當我們默默地站在他身邊時`

And its hand never hung by its side. `而且它的手永遠不會掛在身邊`
But it stopped short, never to go again, `但它靜下再也不走了`
When the old man died. `爺爺走後`
